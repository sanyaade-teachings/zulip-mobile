    //   https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/2967172-registerforremotenotifications?language=occ

    // and sets the eventual result to be the resolution of the
    // Promise we get, so we can know if the user has enabled
    // alerts, the badge count, and sound.)

    //   https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622958-application?language=objc.
    // Following the library's setup instructions, we've asked that
    // method to hand control back to the library.
    //
    // It looks like the library then creates a notification, with the
    // magic-string name "RemoteNotificationsRegistered", using
    //   https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotificationcenter/1415812-postnotificationname?language=objc.
    // It listens for this notification with
    //   https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotificationcenter/1415360-addobserver
    // and, upon receipt, sends a React Native event to the JavaScript
    // part of the library. We can listen to this event, with
    // `PushNotificationIOS.addEventListener`, under the alias
    // 'register'. (We can also listen for registration failure under
    // the alias 'registrationError'.)

    //   register for remote notifications ->
    //   send event we already have a global listener for
